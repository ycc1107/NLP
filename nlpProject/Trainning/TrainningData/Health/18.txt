Tricuspid valve (TV) atresia
INTRODUCTION — Tricuspid valve (TV) atresia is a cyanotic congenital heart lesion that is characterized by congenital agenesis or absence of the tricuspid valve, resulting in no direct communication between the right atrium and ventricle [1]. If untreated, TV atresia has a high mortality rate with a survival rate as low as 10 percent at one year of age, depending on the type of TV atresia and the presence of other cardiac lesions [2,3].
The constellation of anatomic variants, physiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of TV atresia will be reviewed here.
EPIDEMIOLOGY — TV atresia is the third most common cyanotic heart lesion with an estimated prevalence of 0.5 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births [4-7]. There is no difference in the incidence based on gender.
ANATOMY — Although TV atresia is characterized by the absence of the tricuspid valve, there is a spectrum of anatomic variants based on the morphology of the atresia and the presence of other cardiac structural lesions.
Morphology of TV atresia — Morphologic variation of TV atresia includes the following [8,9]:
•	Muscular atresia is the most common form, accounting for approximately 80 percent of patients. In this subtype, there is a solid muscular floor to the right atrium with a dimple in the expected location of the tricuspid valve.
•	Membranous atresia (approximately 10 percent), in which the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum forms the floor of the right atrium.
•	Valvular atresia (5 percent), in which tiny valve cusps are fused together.
•	Ebstein subtype, in which there is both downward displacement and fusion of the tricuspid valve leaflets into the right ventricular wall [10].
•	Rarely, patients with atrioventricular canal defects will have atresia of the right atrioventricular valve when a leaflet of a common atrioventricular valve seals off the entrance to the right ventricle.
Although all the variants are hemodynamically similar, it is important to distinguish the valvular and Ebstein subtypes from the others because of differing surgical approaches. In patients with the Ebstein and valvular subtypes, the surgical approach entails excision of the malformed valve and prosthetic valve replacement, whereas in the other variants, surgical management consists of palliative interventions including the Fontan procedure. (See 'Surgical management' below.)
Associated cardiac lesions — Associated cardiac lesions are universally seen in patients with TV atresia. This was illustrated in a study of 225 consecutive patients with TV atresia cared for at a single Canadian tertiary center between 1971 and 1999 [11]. The following cardiac lesions and their relative frequency were observed:
•	Atrial septal defect (100 percent) – In many cases, the atrial septal defect is a patent foramen ovale. The right atrium is typically enlarged and hypertrophied.
•	Right ventricular hypoplasia (100 percent) – The right ventricle is hypoplastic and often comprises of only the infundibular portion. The inflow portion of the right ventricle can vary in size depending on the size of the ventricular septal defect (VSD).
•	Ventricular septal defect (95 percent) – In TV atresia, muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most commonly observed type of VSD [12]. Malalignment VSDs occur with a lower frequency, but may contribute to subarterial obstruction. VSDs can be large, small, or absent [8]. Spontaneous closure of the VSD has been reported and approximates the incidence of spontaneous closure of isolated VSDs [12]. (See "Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children", section on 'Natural history'.)
•	Pulmonary outflow obstruction (75 percent) – Pulmonary blood flow can be restricted by the presence of a small VSD, pulmonary valve stenosis or hypoplasia, or severe hypoplasia of the right ventricular outflow (eg, pulmonary artery defects).
•	Ventricular arterial discordance including transposition of the great arteries or double outlet right ventricle (28 percent).
•	Severe pulmonary artery hypoplasia or distortion (17 percent).
•	Aortic or subaortic stenosis (11 percent).
•	Aortic coarctation or interruption (8 percent) – Coarctation is frequently associated with transposition of the great arteries [2].
•	Coronary anomaly (3 percent).
CLASSIFICATION — Several classification systems have been developed based on descriptions of the anatomic variants (eg, associated cardiac lesions and the morphology of atresia, described above) [8]. The most widely used schema divides TV atresia into three categories based on the anatomy of the great arteries (aorta and pulmonary artery) [8,13]. Subdivision within the first two categories is based on pulmonary blood flow, and the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) is also used to categorize subtypes. Surgical management is generally based on the anatomy of the great arteries (table 1). (See 'Surgical management' below.)
•	Type I (70 to 80 percent): Normal anatomy of the great arteries
•	Subgroup a – Intact ventricular septum with pulmonary atresia
•	Subgroup b – Small VSD with pulmonary stenosis or hypoplasia
•	Subgroup c – Large VSD without pulmonary stenosis
•	Type II (12 to 25 percent): D-loop transposition of the great arteries (D-loop TGA) (see "Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of D-transposition of the great arteries")
•	Subgroup a – VSD with pulmonary atresia
•	Subgroup b – VSD with pulmonary stenosis or hypoplasia
•	Subgroup c – VSD without pulmonary stenosis
•	Type III (3 to 6 percent): Malposition defects of the great arteries other than D-loop TGA (eg, truncus arteriosus, atrioventricular septal defects, and double outlet right ventricle)
A variation of this schema subdivides type III based on variations in ventricular and arterial alignment, and groups TV atresia with truncus arteriosus as type IV [4,8].
PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of TV atresia is unknown. It is thought that most cases of TV atresia (muscular, membranous, and valvular subtypes) are derived from a similar disruption of normal development of the atrioventricular valves from the endocardial cushions and delamination of the ventricular myocardium. (See 'Morphology of TV atresia' above.)
Genetics — In some cases, an underlying genetic defect may contribute to the disruption of the normal development of the tricuspid valve. Although no specific gene defect has been identified, supporting evidence for a genetic contribution includes the following:
•	Studies in mice with TV atresia have identified mutations in the Fog-2 gene (also referred to as Zfpm2) [14]. The multi-zinc protein product of Fog-2 gene has a role in early cardiac development.
•	Familial occurrence of TV atresia has been reported in three siblings, suggesting an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance [15].
•	Association with chromosomal and syndromic conditions including trisomy 18 and 21, chromosomal 8 deletion, and VACTERL association (vertebral anomaly, anal atresia, cardiac defect, tracheoesophageal fistula, and renal and limb abnormalities) [16].
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — In TV atresia, the only exit of blood from the right atrium is through an interatrial communication. This obligate right-to-left atrial shunting is necessary for survival, as it allows deoxygenated systemic venous blood to enter the left atrium and subsequently, the left ventricle. As a result of the mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood in the left atrium, some level of cyanosis is always present (figure 1).
Pulmonary blood flow in patients with TV atresia depends on the anatomy of the great arteries and the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) (table 1 andfigure 1). (See 'Classification' above.)
•	Type I TV atresia with normal anatomy of the great arteries:
•	In patients with no VSD (subtype Ia), there is no pulmonary blood flow from the right ventricle. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the only source of pulmonary blood flow. Systemic blood flow is derived directly from the left ventricle.
•	In patients with a VSD (subtypes Ib and Ic), the left-to-right flow of blood from the left to right ventricle across the VSD is the source of pulmonary blood flow. The size of the VSD and the degree of pulmonary stenosis dictate the amount of pulmonary blood flow, which in turn can manifest as pulmonary overcirculation (excessive pulmonary blood flow) or cyanosis (restrictive pulmonary blood flow). In some patients with restricted blood flow, a PDA is critical for survival. Systemic blood flow is derived directly from the left ventricle.
•	In patients with type II TV atresia with transposed great arteries, pulmonary blood flow is derived directly from the left ventricle and systemic blood flow from the right ventricle. In these patients, a VSD is critical, as the right ventricle, which provides the systemic circulation through the aorta, is dependent on blood flowing from the left ventricle through the VSD. The presence of a restrictive or closing VSD and/or right ventricular infundibular narrowing results in obstruction of systemic blood flow. If the obstruction is critical (severe), this results in diminished systemic circulation leading to hypotension and, possibly, cardiogenic shock. In these patients, a PDA is critical for survival.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Fetal presentation — Advances in ultrasound technology have enabled antenatal screening between 18 and 22 weeks gestation to accurately make the diagnosis of TV atresia (image 1) [17]. TV atresia is compatible with fetal survival, but there are significant changes in fetal heart circulation. In the normal fetal heart, the right ventricle is the dominant ventricle with distribution of about 65 percent of the combined cardiac output, whereas the left ventricle distributes 35 percent of the output, which has entered the left atrium through the foramen ovale (figure 2). The blood flow in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is normally right-to-left from the right ventricle to the descending aorta. In contrast, in fetuses with TV atresia, the left ventricle assumes a dominant role as all of the systemic venous return crosses the foramen ovale from the right to left atrium, and subsequently the left ventricle (figure 3). The presence of reverse (left-to-right flow) blood flow in the PDA suggests inadequate pulmonary outflow, which in turn indicates the need for postnatal initiation of prostaglandin therapy to maintain ductal patency required for adequate pulmonary blood flow and for survival. (See 'Initial medical management'below.)
In two case series of prenatally diagnosed TV atresia, about 4 percent of cases resulted in intrauterine death [16,18]. In both cohorts, the cause of death could not be ascertained, but a restrictive atrial level communication resulting in fetal hydrops was suggested as a cause for intrauterine demise [19]. There was also a significant rate of elective termination including 25 of 88 pregnancies in one study (28 percent), and 17 of 54 in the other (32 percent).
In one of the above studies, extracardiac anomalies were observed in 12 of the 54 cases; five with chromosomal anomalies, two with VACTERL association (vertebral anomaly, anal atresia, cardiac defect, tracheoesophageal fistula, and renal and limb abnormalities), and one fetus each with unilateral renal agenesis, hypospadia, hydrothorax, megacystis, and agenesis of the ductus venosus [18]. In addition, other case reports have observed increased nuchal thickness with normal karyotype in fetuses with TV atresia [17,20].
Postnatal presentation — Approximately 50 percent of patients who present postnatally with TV atresia do so on the first day of life, while an additional 30 percent present by one month of age [2]. The typical presenting symptoms are cyanosis and a heart murmur [2].
The clinical course and manifestations vary depending on the presence of other associated cardiac lesions (table 1). (See 'Classification' above.)
•	Pulmonary atresia — In patients with tricuspid and pulmonary valve atresia (types Ia and IIa), pulmonary blood flow is derived exclusively from a PDA. As the PDA closes in response to increasing arterial oxygen levels, these infants develop hypoxemia and acidosis. Closure of the PDA can be prevented with the initiation of prostaglandin therapy. (See 'Initial medical management' below.)
•	Ventricular septal defect (VSD) and normally related great arteries — In patients with normal anatomy of the great arteries and VSD (types Ib and Ic), the following spectrum of clinical manifestations are observed:
•	In the absence of restricted pulmonary blood flow with a large VSD and no pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary blood flow increases in the first few weeks of life as the pulmonary vascular resistance drops. Symptoms of pulmonary overcirculation and heart failure are seen within two to three weeks after birth [4]. (See "Etiology and diagnosis of heart failure in infants and children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)
•	Patients with a small VSD or severe pulmonary stenosis will have a clinical course similar to those with pulmonary atresia. Patients with inadequate pulmonary blood flow will need initial management with prostaglandin infusion to maintain patency of a PDA to ensure adequate pulmonary blood flow.
•	Because patients with TV atresia generally have a muscular VSD and the natural history of muscular VSD is to decrease in size over time, these patients may have episodes of hypoxic spells with increasing restriction of pulmonary blood flow as there is a decrease in the left-to-right shunting of blood through the shrinking VSD.
•	Transposition of the great vessels (type II) — In patients with D-loop transposition of the great arteries (TGA) (type II), the aorta arises from the hypoplastic right ventricle. Since there is mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations through an atrial level communication, postnatal circulation is similar to fetal circulation. As a result, patients present with cyanosis or decreased oxygen saturation. These patients may develop symptoms of pulmonary overcirculation (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing). However, in patients with aortic arch hypoplasia, coarctation may develop as the PDA closes because of constriction of ductal tissue in the affected region of the aorta. As a result, maintenance of ductal patency may be required to preserve flow into the aorta.
Physical examination — Central cyanosis is generally the most notable feature on physical examination. In addition, other findings include the following:
•	On auscultation, a single second heart sound is heard. A holosystolic murmur may be heard at the left, lower sternal border when a VSD is present. A continuous murmur may be evident in the setting of pulmonary atresia with a PDA.
•	In patients with a restrictive atrial level communication, jugular venous distension with a prominent “a” wave and hepatomegaly may be detected.
•	In patients with unrestrictive pulmonary blood flow, tachypnea may be present. In those with significant pulmonary blood flow a diastolic rumble may be appreciated at the apex due to excessive mitral valve flow. This finding often signifies imbalance in circulation with a disproportionately large amount of pulmonary blood flow.
•	Femoral pulses may be diminished with coarctation of the aorta.
Initial tests — Most patients will undergo initial testing that includes pulse oximetry screening, chest radiography, and electrocardiography. However, the diagnosis is generally made by echocardiography.
Pulse oximetry — Pulse oximetry, or arterial blood gas sampling, reveals oxygen desaturation consistent with the physical findings of cyanosis (table 2). The systemic oxygen saturation depends on the amount of left-to-right shunt through a PDA or in some cases, VSD. (See "Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Oxygen saturation'.)
Chest radiography — In the frontal projection of the chest radiograph, the smooth convexity of the right heart border is not seen and the lower aspect of the right heart border does not extend beyond the spine (image 2) [21,22]. There is variability in the heart size and prominence of pulmonary vascular findings depending on pulmonary blood flow:
•	In patients with normal or decreased pulmonary blood flow (no VSD or small restricted VSD), there is a paucity of pulmonary markings and the heart size is usually normal.
•	In patients with increased pulmonary blood flow (eg, large VSD), there is often cardiomegaly and prominence of pulmonary vascularity.
Electrocardiogram — Surface electrocardiogram demonstrates tall P waves, left axis deviation with a superior axis (>30°), left ventricular hypertrophy, and diminished right ventricular forces (waveform 1). In a cyanotic infant, the above findings can be pathognomonic for TV atresia [4,23]. In patients with excessive pulmonary blood flow, a normal axis or right axis deviation can be seen [23].
Natural course — The natural course of this disease in the absence of surgical intervention is poor with a reported mortality of about 75 percent and the majority of deaths occurring in early childhood [21].
DIAGNOSIS
Fetal diagnosis — Fetal echocardiography, in the typical four-chamber view, can accurately make a diagnosis of TV atresia between 18 and 22 weeks gestation by detecting the presence of a hypoplastic right ventricle, and no patent tricuspid valve (image 1) [16,17]. Additional evaluation by fetal echocardiography should include assessment of the ventricular septum, relationship of the great arteries, status of pulmonary outflow, direction of flow in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), patency of the atrial level communication, and assessment for presence of fetal hydrops. As noted above, the presence of reverse flow (left-to-right flow) in the ductus arteriosus suggests inadequate pulmonary outflow, which in turn indicates the need for postnatal initiation of prostaglandin infusion to maintain a PDA for adequate pulmonary blood flow and for survival. (See'Initial medical management' below.)
Postnatal diagnosis
Echocardiography — The postnatal definitive diagnosis of TV atresia is generally made by echocardiography, which includes both anatomic and hemodynamic evaluation. The characteristic anatomic features of an absent tricuspid valve, atrial septal defect, and right ventricular hypoplasia are readily demonstrated by two-dimensional echocardiography (image 3).
Echocardiography should also assess the location and relationship of the great arteries, the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect including the degree of left-to-right shunting, the presence of pulmonary outflow obstruction, and the atrial level communication to rule out restriction to systemic and pulmonary venous mixing. In the presence of D-loop transposition of the great arteries (TGA) (type II), the aortic arch must be assessed by two-dimensional and color Doppler imaging to determine whether there is coarctation of the aorta.
Other imaging tests — Currently, other imaging modalities are rarely used to make the diagnosis of TV atresia:
•	Cardiac catheterization has largely been replaced by echocardiography to make the diagnosis of TV atresia. It may be useful in delineating the anatomy in more complex lesions (eg, type III (table 1)). In addition, hemodynamic and angiographic assessment with cardiac catheterization provides useful information prior to palliative interventions.
•	Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan can be helpful for evaluation in adults.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of most cases of TV atresia includes other cyanotic cardiac conditions that present with decreased pulmonary blood flow. (See "Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn", section on 'Decreased pulmonary blood flow'.)
Echocardiography distinguishes TV atresia from these other cardiac lesions:
•	Tetralogy of Fallot
•	Tricuspid stenosis
•	Pulmonary valve atresia
•	Critical valvar pulmonary stenosis
In addition, echocardiography differentiates those cases of TV atresia with increased pulmonary blood flow due to a large ventricular septal defect from other cardiac lesions with increased pulmonary blood flow. These conditions include D-loop transposition of the great arteries (TGA), truncus arteriosus, and totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection. (See "Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn", section on 'Increased pulmonary blood flow'.)
MANAGEMENT
Overview — Neonates with TV atresia should be cared for at a tertiary medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease (CHD). When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be given immediately after birth.
The management of TV atresia consists of the following:
•	Initial medical management that ensures maintenance of adequate pulmonary blood flow and cardiovascular stability.
•	Staged univentricular palliation. Cardiac transplantation, while an option, is not the preferred surgical approach owing, in part, to the scarcity of organs, as well the improved success with surgical palliation.
•	If confounding factors preclude multiple surgical procedures (eg, multiple congenital anomalies or significant cerebrovascular accident), parents and care providers may choose compassionate care as a management approach for the infant.
Initial medical management — Initial management is focused on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function, and ensuring adequate pulmonary blood flow through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The goal of initial treatment is to stabilize and optimize the neonate’s condition so that palliative repair can be performed.
Therapy consists of:
•	Administration of prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) to maintain adequate ductal dependent pulmonary blood flow. (See "Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Prostaglandin E1'.)
•	General cardiorespiratory support for infants with respiratory compromise, hypotension, poor perfusion, acidosis, and hypothermia. These measures include respiratory support (eg, supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation), inotropic agents, and correction of acidosis and metabolic derangements (eg, hypoglycemia). (See"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'General supportive care'.)
Surgical management — The goal of staged single ventricular palliation is to ensure adequate pulmonary and systemic blood flow with eventual separation of the two circulatory systems. As is true for most univentricular conditions such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the surgical management of TV atresia consists of three staged palliative procedures typically performed at the following ages:
•	First stage is performed in neonates.
•	Second stage (eg, Glenn procedure) is usually performed at three to six months of age.
•	Third stage (eg, Fontan procedure) is usually performed at two to three years of age.
In most institutions including our own center, the Glenn and Fontan operations are performed as two stages to allow the body to adapt to the different hemodynamic states and reduce overall surgical morbidity and mortality. Others have advocated for a nonstaged approach to Fontan palliation [24]. Each approach carries its own set of advantages, but data are lacking on the superiority of one approach over the other.
First stage — First stage of surgery is performed in the neonatal period. The goals of the initial palliation are to ensure that blood exiting the right atrium is unimpeded, provides adequate pulmonary blood flow, protects the pulmonary artery bed from high pressures that could result in higher risk for subsequent operations, and ensures unobstructed flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. Choices for intervention are dependent on the anatomic variants as follows (table 1):
•	TV atresia with normally related great arteries (type I)
•	With diminished pulmonary blood flow, the initial surgery soon after birth aims to restore a reliable source of pulmonary blood flow with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (shunt from the innominate artery into the central pulmonary artery).
•	In the presence of unobstructed pulmonary blood flow (type Ic), a pulmonary artery band may be placed in early infancy to restrict the amount of pulmonary blood flow and protect the pulmonary bed from high systemic pressures. As mentioned above, the vast majority of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) decrease in size over time and restrict pulmonary blood flow. A pulmonary artery band, therefore, may not be required in all patients who have unobstructed pulmonary flow at birth through a VSD, and could be restricted to patients who are symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy for pulmonary congestion/heart failure. Furthermore, a pulmonary artery band may stimulate myocardial hypertrophy that may more rapidly reduce the size of the VSD.
•	Rarely, the degree of restriction to pulmonary blood flow is enough to maintain adequate oxygenation without pulmonary overcirculation and heart failure. These patients may not require surgery in the neonatal period and can be taken directly to the second stage of palliation.
•	TV atresia with transposition of great arteries (type II)
•	In the presence of significant subaortic obstruction with a restrictive VSD, enlargement of the VSD or a Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis (anastomosis between the main pulmonary artery and ascending aorta) with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt is the initial surgery of choice.
•	If an isolated coarctation is present, it should be relieved and a pulmonary artery band may be considered to restrict pulmonary blood flow.
•	Similar to type I lesions, in a few cases, the size of the VSD is large enough to maintain systemic output, in which case a pulmonary artery band alone may be adequate.
Second stage — The second palliative procedure for both type I and type II lesions is a cavopulmonary anastomosis (Glenn procedure). This stage of palliation is typically performed at three to six months of life when infants experience progressive cyanosis as they begin to outgrow their neonatal shunt. This surgery involves removal of the original shunt, and direct anastomosis of the superior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery. The Glenn procedure relies on passive venous drainage from the superior vena cava directly into the pulmonary artery. However, there is persistent systemic desaturation due to continued inferior vena cava flow into the right atrium. In a case series of 557 patients who underwent second stage palliation for single ventricle anatomy from 1998 to 2010, the overall mortality rate was low (4.7 percent) and there were no deaths in the 12 percent of patients who had TV atresia [25].
Third stage — Several variants of the Fontan procedure have been used in the final stage of palliation for TV atresia, and commonly entail direct anastomosis of the right atrium into the pulmonary arteries, thereby completely separating the pulmonary and systemic circulation [26,27]. Subsequent modifications include the use of a lateral tunnel or an extracardiac conduit [28] As a result of the Fontan procedure, the blood that returns to the common atrium (left) is fully oxygenated and the single left ventricle serves as the systemic pump. Timing of surgery is variable, but is usually at two to three years of age when the there is progressive cyanosis due to increased physical activity.
Long-term complications associated with the classic right atrium to pulmonary artery anastomosis include right atrial enlargement, refractory atrial arrhythmias, poor exercise capacity, failing ventricular function, and protein losing enteropathy [29]. As a result, Fontan revision with total cavopulmonary anastomosis with atrial reduction and surgical ablation of atrial tachycardia circuits have been undertaken with the goal of improving survival and exercise tolerance, and reducing the need for antiarrhythmic agents [29-31], but the optimal timing for such conversion is unclear.
OUTCOME
Survival — Better patient selection, improved surgical techniques, and postoperative management have contributed to lowering postoperative mortality in patients undergoing palliative repair. Currently, the postoperative mortality following Fontan operation for TV atresia is estimated at 2 to 5 percent with a reported 10-year survival rate of 80 percent [11,24].
•	In a single center study of 255 patients with TV atresia followed from 1971 to 1999, the reported overall survival was 81, 70, and 60 percent at 1, 10, and 20 years respectively [11]. In this study, 10 patients died before any interventions could be initiated and three patients were lost to follow-up. Improved survival was observed in the 137 patients who underwent Fontan procedure with overall survival rates of 93 and 82 percent at 1 and 10 years, respectively.
•	In another case series of 216 patients who underwent Fontan procedure for TV atresia over a 25-year period from 1973 to 1998, the overall survival was 79 percent at a mean follow-up period of 13 years [24]. In this study, the postoperative mortality rate steadily declined over the 25 years from a postoperative mortality rate of 17 percent in the early years of the study to 2 percent in the last decade.
Morbidity — Although the Fontan operation is the definitive palliative surgery of choice for patients with a single dominant ventricle, and a vast number of patients enjoy a good quality of life, the long-term complications are not negligible and include the following [32]:
•	Atrial arrhythmias with a reported incidence ranging from 6 to 33 percent [33,34]. Patients with an atriopulmonary connection appear to be at highest risk for atrial tachyarrhythmias [33].
•	Thromboembolic events with an estimated incidence between 2.2 and 19 percent [35]. The combination of passive flowing circuit and increased risk of coagulation factor abnormalities due to hepatic congestion predispose these patients to thrombotic events. (See "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome", section on 'Thrombotic complications'.)
•	Complications related to the lymphatic system, including protein losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis have been reported to occur in about 10 percent of patients, but the risk of these complications is decreasing with improved surgical and medical care [35].
•	Exercise tolerance — Overall, exercise performance is decreased in patients with single ventricular physiology due to suboptimal augmentation of stroke volume and cardiac output [35]. Patients with single morphologic left ventricle have comparatively better exercise capacity than those with single right ventricles such as in hypoplastic left heart syndrome [36]. The age of Fontan procedure appears to inversely correlate with exercise capacity. In addition, decreased exercise capacity appears to correlate with mortality [37,38].
HEALTH CARE MAINTENANCE
Follow-up care — After the initial stage of palliation, the infant should be followed with close cardiac monitoring for signs of progressive cyanosis or congestive heart failure if necessary. Prior to stage II and stage III, a comprehensive evaluation including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization should be undertaken to evaluate for hemodynamic and anatomic suitability. Interventions to address any residual anatomic lesions such as branch pulmonary artery stenosis, aortic coarctation, and coiling aortopulmonary collaterals can be undertaken during these catheterizations.
In the long term, the interval between clinical assessments and diagnostic studies will largely depend on symptomatology.
•	Annual clinic visits including electrocardiography for evaluation of underlying rhythm and echocardiographic assessment of ventricular and valvar function.
•	Periodic, objective assessment of exercise capacity with exercise testing would help to longitudinally assess patient status.
Vaccination — Patients with TV atresia should receive all recommended vaccinations, including yearly influenza vaccines and palivizumab for prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus in patients younger than two years of age with hemodynamically significant disease (table 3). [39] Vaccinations are usually administered six weeks after major cardiac procedures or surgery. (See "Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Prevention", section on 'Congenital heart disease'.)
Endocarditis prophylaxis — Prophylactic antibiotics for endocarditis are recommended for the following:
•	Cyanotic patients with unrepaired lesion or with a palliative shunt.
•	Following complete Fontan palliation, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in the first six months.
•	Beyond the six month period, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for those with a prior episode of endocarditis.
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for dental procedures that include gingival manipulation and invasive procedures including the respiratory tract, skin, and musculoskeletal system. It is not recommended for gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures. (See "Antimicrobial prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis".)
Exercise restrictions — The guidelines for patients who are post Fontan procedure generally limit participation to class IA, low-intensity competitive sports (figure 4) [40,41]. However, if patients have normal ventricular function and oxygen saturation they may be allowed to participate in class IB sports.
Prior to sports participation a thorough evaluation, including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and exercise testing is recommended to assess ventricular function and oxygen saturation, and to detect any cardiac arrhythmia.
Pregnancy — Although successful pregnancies carried to term following Fontan surgeries have been reported in a select group of patients with favorable hemodynamics, the reported rates of spontaneous abortion (about 30 to 40 percent) and preterm delivery (25 to 30 percent) are significant [24,42]. In addition, there is a maternal risk of developing heart failure. Prenatal education and counseling regarding the potential hazards of pregnancy for the mother and the fetus, and planned delivery at high-risk obstetric center is recommended [43]. A comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation by a congenital cardiac specialist is recommended to address any cardiovascular symptoms or signs that may be best treated before pregnancy or to identify factors that may pose significant maternal risk where pregnancy is not advised.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
•	Tricuspid valve (TV) atresia is characterized by congenital agenesis or absence of the tricuspid valve with no direct communication between the right atrium and ventricle.
•	TV atresia is the third most common cyanotic heart condition with an estimated prevalence of 0.5 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)
•	There is a spectrum of anatomic variants based on the morphology of the atresia and the presence of other cardiac structural lesions (eg, ventricular septal defect [VSD] and abnormal anatomy of the great arteries). (See 'Anatomy' above.)
•	The most widely used classification for TV atresia is based on the associated anatomic defects, particularly the anatomy of the great arteries, the presence and size of a VSD, and pulmonary blood flow. Surgical management is based on the anatomy of the great arteries (table 1). (See 'Classification' above.)
•	The pathogenesis of TV atresia is unknown, and is thought to be due to disruption of the normal development of the atrioventricular valves from the endocardial cushions and delamination of the ventricular myocardium. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)
•	In TV atresia, the only exit of blood from the right atrium is through an interatrial communication. This obligate right-to-left atrial shunting is necessary for survival. In some patients, ductal patency may be required to maintain adequate pulmonary blood flow. (See 'Pathophysiology' above.)
•	Patients can present prenatally, as routine antenatal screening with echocardiography can accurately make the diagnosis of TV atresia in the fetuses (image 1). Postnatally, patients present as neonates with cyanosis and a heart murmur. Other clinical features and course are dependent on the presence of associated cardiac lesions. (See 'Clinical presentation' above.)
•	Initial laboratory testing includes pulse oximetry screening or arterial blood gas sampling that demonstrates oxygen desaturation (table 2); chest radiograph with a loss of the smooth convexity of the right heart border (image 2); and an electrocardiograph that demonstrates right atrial enlargement (tall P waves), superior axis (>30°), left ventricular hypertrophy, and diminished right ventricular forces (waveform 1). (See 'Initial tests' above.)
•	The definitive diagnosis of TV atresia is generally made by echocardiography with the detection of the characteristic anatomic features of an absent tricuspid valve, atrial septal defect, and right ventricular hypoplasia (image 1 and image 3). (See 'Diagnosis' above.)
•	We recommend that all neonates with TV atresia be treated in a medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease (Grade 1C). When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be given immediately after birth. (See 'Management' above.)
•	We recommend that all neonates be treated with the following management approach of initial stabilization and subsequent palliative repair (Grade 1B).
•	Initial stabilization includes general cardiorespiratory support and administration of prostaglandin E1 to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in infants who have a ductal dependent lesion. (See 'Initial medical management' above.)
•	Surgical management of TV atresia consists of three staged palliative procedures. The third stage is a modified Fontan procedure that separates completely the pulmonary and systemic circulation while maintaining adequate blood flow in each. (See 'Surgical management' above.)
•	The natural course of this disease in the absence of surgical intervention is poor with a reported mortality of about 75 percent, primarily occurring in early childhood. With the advance in surgical and medical management, the overall survival has improved with reported survival of 80 percent at 10 years. Long-term morbidity includes ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmia, risk of thrombosis, and complications related to lymphatic dysfunction. (See 'Outcome' above.)
•	Health care maintenance includes ongoing monitoring of cardiac function and exercise tolerance, endocarditis prophylaxis, and appropriate vaccination including influenza vaccines and palivizumab for prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (table 3). Most patients who undergo Fontan procedure should be limited to class IA, low-intensity competitive sports (figure 4). (See 'Health care maintenance' above.)
