The gifted child: Educational interventions and primary care management
INTRODUCTION — Gifted individuals have exceptional abilities in a particular domain or domains (eg, mathematics, music, athletics). In addition, they typically have high degrees of self-motivation, curiosity, perseverance, and enjoyment in developing and expressing their talents [1].
This topic review will discuss educational interventions for and the primary care management of gifted children. The characteristics and identification of giftedness are discussed separately. (See "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification".)
TERMINOLOGY — There is no universally accepted definition for giftedness, which can manifest in a variety of ways. Other terms that are used to describe giftedness include “outstanding talent”, “gifted and talented”, and “high-ability”. (See "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Terminology'.)
The United States Department of Education (DOE) definition for giftedness is the most widely accepted by researchers and practitioners in the field of giftedness (table 1) [2]. The DOE definition is similar to that provided by the National Association for Gifted Children [3]. In the United States, most state boards of education provide definitions forgifted/giftedness, but the definitions may differ from the US DOE definition [4]. The definitions used by individual states are available from the National Association for Gifted Children.
SCHOOL-HOUSE GIFTEDNESS
Overview — The development of intellectual or school-house giftedness, like any form of giftedness, is a long-term endeavor, fostered by early identification, supportive and encouraging parents, and teachers and mentors who place high expectations on the student [5]. Gifted students need to be challenged to maintain interest and high achievement [6]. Those who are not sufficiently challenged may develop maladaptive behaviors, mental health conditions (eg, depression), and/or academic failure [7-9]. Lack of challenge can inhibit the development of self-confidence that comes from mastering difficult material and can lead to poor study habits, which may be difficult to overcome in higher education [7].
Given the variety of ways in which students can be gifted and the range of domain-specific abilities within a given student, educational interventions and strategies to challenge gifted students must be determined on a case by case basis. The “optimal match” is a curriculum that matches the child’s cognitive abilities, maturity, and academic interests and is sufficiently challenging that it requires the child to work to succeed, but not so challenging that he or she becomes discouraged [10,11].
Factors to be considered in choosing an educational program include the student’s pattern of strengths and weaknesses, the student’s social and emotional maturity, the types of programming available through the local school system, the availability of programs outside of the school setting, and family resources [11]. The ultimate decision may represent a compromise based on the advantages and disadvantages of the available options.
There are few high-quality studies evaluating educational interventions or strategies for gifted children [12]. Educational practices that are used for gifted children have influenced general education practices, and in some cases may have been derived from special education. As such, educational practices that are useful for gifted children are useful for a wide range of students [13-15]. These practices include:
•	Recognition of individual differences
•	Focusing on concepts rather than learning a skill
•	Using an interdisciplinary curriculum and theme-based studies
•	Using alternative methods of assessment (eg, student portfolios or performance assessment)
•	Using peers for teaching and learning
•	Problem-based learning emphasizing metacognition (ie, the use of general or prior knowledge and skills to address new learning problems)
Guidelines for the education of gifted students suggest that such students [16,17]:
•	Be provided with acceleration and enrichment experiences or activities
•	Spend the majority of their school day with others of similar abilities and interests, whether this is part of a high ability group within their grade, or in a higher grade
•	Can be grouped with students not functioning at the same ability level, but primarily for non-academic portions of the school day
Availability — The educational opportunities available for gifted students vary from community to community [7,18,19]. Programs and services for students are determined by state laws and policies and are funded at the state and local level. There is wide variation in funding and eligibility definitions [6,18,19]. Gifted programming may not be a priority in low-income communities or in communities where education is not valued. In such communities, gifted programming may not be offered by the local school district, even though students in that district may be in need of gifted programming.
In the United States, information about educational options for gifted children in a given state is available from the state’s Department of Education Web site or local school boards and special education departments [20]. Individual state board of education definitions for giftedness are available through the National Association for Gifted Children[4].
Types of intervention — Programming for children with school-house (ie, academic or intellectual) giftedness must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Specific types of educational interventions or strategies include:
•	Acceleration
•	Enrichment
•	Ability grouping
•	Programs focusing on meta-cognitive skills and self-regulation
These interventions may overlap (ie, a program can be accelerated and enriched) [21].
The evidence about the relative merits of different types of programming is largely inconclusive [22]. However, in experimental and controlled studies, acceleration and enrichment have been beneficial in increasing academic achievement [11,23-25]. The gifted learner typically benefits most from both acceleration and enrichment.
Acceleration — Acceleration is the practice of allowing the gifted student to learn at his or her own pace. It can occur for one or multiple academic areas and with or without advanced grade placement. With accelerated programming, the usual curriculum may be taught at a faster pace or the student may be permitted to skip formal instruction on the material that he or she already knows. The student may be placed in a higher grade for one or several classes, may be allowed to skip a grade, or may be allowed to complete coursework in less time than it takes other students (eg, to complete high school in less than the typical four years) [7].
Acceleration assumes that gifted children learn faster than their peers, but that they learn in the same way (ie, that they are qualitatively similar). This question remains open [26]. Nevertheless, in experimental and controlled studies, acceleration has been associated with improvement in educational progress (sustained interest and involvement in academic activities with high-levels of academic success) of gifted students [6,23,27,28]. Acceleration also may raise educational standards for non-gifted students [14,29].
There are concerns that acceleration may affect the student’s social adjustment and that the student may fail to participate in extracurricular activities with classmates who are chronologically older [11]. However, there is no evidence that acceleration is detrimental to the social or emotional adjustment of gifted students when the acceleration is well-planned [10,28,30].
Factors to be considered in determining whether acceleration should be undertaken for an individual student include intelligence quotient (IQ), academic skill level (eg, it should be above the mean of the desired grade level), social and emotional maturity to interact with older peers, and whether the child is receptive to acceleration [10]. Information about the policies regarding acceleration in individual states of the United States is available through the Institute for Research and Policy on Acceleration.
Grade skipping — Grade skipping (also known as double-promotion) is a broad-based form of acceleration that does not take into account the student’s specific pattern of abilities or the possibility that gifted and nongifted students learn in different ways [21]. Advanced grade placement without other interventions does not guarantee an appropriate educational experience.
The major concern with grade-skipping is that it places gifted students with students who are physically more advanced and also may be different socially and emotionally. Grade skipping is often avoided for fear of causing social maladjustment. Research findings about social maladjustment are mixed, but suggest that decisions about grade-skipping should be made on case-by-case basis [21]. Grade skipping may be an option for a moderately gifted student who is a rapid learner with a good memory, but should probably be avoided for profoundly gifted students who would need to be placed with children significantly more advanced in age in order to match their intellectual skills.
Enrichment — Enrichment is the practice of increasing the depth and breadth of content. Enrichment can occur by providing higher-level texts or exposure to other media that explore the topic in greater depth and/or make connections to other disciplines. Enrichment may consist of increasing the knowledge content for the student, allowing the student to participate in special projects related to the course (eg, reports, presentations), or teaching the student creative or other critical thinking skills that may or may not be related to the course content [17,21].
Enrichment can be beneficial to various students, not just those who are gifted [17,18]. However, it may not be appropriate for students who are markedly advanced [11]. Asking such students to complete additional work at the same level of difficulty does not enhance growth, teach perseverance, require the development of study skills, or combat boredom.
Ability grouping — Ability grouping refers to using test scores or other measures of achievement to assign students with similar abilities to learning groups [6]. Students of similar abilities can be placed in self-contained classrooms for gifted students, grouped together within a classroom (or across grades) for specific subjects, or attend schools designed for gifted students (eg, magnet schools, science and math schools, private schools that require achievement or IQ testing for admission) [6,21].
Ability grouping has not been studied sufficiently to draw firm conclusions. In meta-analyses of evaluations of self-contained classes for gifted children, ability grouping without curriculum modifications (eg, enrichment or acceleration) resulted in minimal or no gains [27,31]. Simply learning alongside peers of similar ability does not provide the stimulation needed by the gifted child. However, when combined with appropriate curriculum modifications, ability grouping was associated with improved performance on standardized tests [27]. Ability grouping within the classroom does not appear to affect the educational outcomes of students who are not placed in the high-ability group [18]. (See 'Acceleration' above and 'Enrichment' above.)
Ability grouping must be distinguished from “cooperative learning”. Cooperative learning places students into groups without regard to ability. It is commonly used in general education. Cooperative learning may not be effective for gifted students if the peer group is at a different ability level [25]. Gifted students can become bored or domineering when placed alongside less able peers.
Out-of-school programs — Some programs for gifted children occur outside of the regular classroom. Programs for gifted students may meet on weekends or during the summer. Such programs are a type of ability grouping because the classes are only open to gifted students, who may qualify through a “talent search” [21]. Acceleration, enrichment, or a combination of both can be used in these out-of-school programs. Out-of-school programs may or may not connect with the student’s experience during the academic year [18]. (See 'Acceleration' above and 'Enrichment' above.)
Meta-cognitive skills and self-regulated learning — Metacognitive skills and self-regulated learning are additional approaches that may be of value for some gifted students [6,21,32-35]. Meta-cognitive skills use prior knowledge, or knowledge from several disciplines, to solve complex and novel problems. Self-regulated learning skills are the skills required by students to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own learning. The student is taught to become aware of his/her attitude towards learning (curiosity, persistence, self-confidence), and develop the skills of choosing his/her own goals, planning the steps needed to reach the goal, and verifying success in executing the plan.
Social and emotional development — Educational programming for gifted children can address social and emotional development through [6]:
•	Ensuring time to learn with others of similar abilities
•	Providing opportunities to explore areas of interest with a variety of peers
•	Provision of mentoring or coaching to cope with the stress, criticism, and the social demands of high achievement
•	Developing approaches to help gifted students support one another (eg, group interventions that provide direct instruction in conflict resolution, decision making, and leadership)
Special populations
Profoundly gifted — Profoundly gifted students may be under-challenged even in a gifted program [11,21,36]. They may not find their appropriate level of challenge until they reach college. Grade skipping generally should probably be avoided for profoundly gifted students who would need to be placed with significantly older peers in order to match their intellectual skills. (See 'Grade skipping' above.)
Gifted with learning disability — Services for students who are gifted and also have a learning disability (LD) ideally should include a combination of enrichment and/oracceleration in the academic area of strength and remediation (eg, special education services) for the areas of weakness [37]. This may result in grade level asynchronies within the student’s educational program. (See 'Acceleration' above and 'Enrichment' above and "Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management", section on 'Quality instruction for LD'.)
The accommodations and interventions for LD that are available through special education should be made available to the gifted student with LD, but only if the developmental demands in the areas of weakness are appropriate to the student’s ability level. As an example, it may not be appropriate to place a gifted student who has LD into a class for students with LD, because the gifted-LD student may perform better than the nongifted-LD students. The gifted-LD student may best be served by providing supports and services in a general education setting. (See "Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management".)
Gifted-LD children may not qualify for special education services if the school does not recognize their area(s) of weakness as a LD [38]. This may occur if the child’s level of function is within the average range for his or her age or grade, even if it is substantially lower than his or her general cognitive ability. (See "Specific learning disabilities in children: Evaluation", section on 'Determination of service eligibility'.)
A detailed discussion of educational interventions for gifted students with coexisting LD is beyond the scope of this topic review, but can be found in the following references [3,37,39].
NONSCHOOL-HOUSE GIFTEDNESS — The literature provides little guidance about how to address the needs of children who are gifted in nonacademic domains. Giftedness in areas such as art, music, athletics, and other domains generally is addressed by professionals trained in these domains. The approach for a particular child will vary depending upon the professional who takes on the mentoring or teaching role.
ROLE OF THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER — The primary care provider can play an important role in identifying giftedness and coexisting conditions and providing anticipatory guidance and support to families with a gifted child [6,7]. This section will focus on the provision of anticipatory guidance and support. The role of the primary care provider in identification of giftedness is discussed separately. (See "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Role of the primary care provider'.)
Gifted children, particularly profoundly gifted children pose special challenges to families. The demands of caring for a gifted child can, at times, be similar to those of caring for a child with a disability. The primary care provider can support the family by providing anticipatory guidance to promote a healthy balance for the family as a whole, monitoring the gifted child for specific vulnerabilities, and helping the family find appropriate educational programming for their child.
The primary care provider’s awareness of the special concerns of gifted children and their families can help gifted children to succeed. Like all children, gifted children are more likely to succeed if their needs are understood and addressed.
Anticipatory guidance
For the child — It is important for the primary care provider to help the gifted child to understand how he or she is different from other children and to value those differences. Nonetheless, gifted children should understand that they are expected to:
•	Complete activities of daily life and respect and follow the household’s rules of conduct
•	Have friends and have fun
•	Perform well at school, both in terms of academic function and classroom participation behaviors
For the family — Families play a central role in developing the talents of a gifted child; they serve as the child’s initial teachers and can nurture the child’s curiosity [7]. However, fostering the abilities of gifted children may require time, energy, and financial resources [7,10]. Families may feel pressured to provide enriched experiences and burdened by time and financial commitments. Parenting and living with a gifted child can be challenging, particularly if the child has a coexisting condition [25]. The pressures on the gifted child to succeed can be a significant stressor for the family. Siblings of the gifted child may receive less attention from the parents.
Families may need guidance about how to manage the differences imposed by giftedness, and to normalize their experience of feeling inadequate to the task of raising a gifted child. The parents may not feel prepared to address the child’s asynchronous development, internal drive, perfectionism, questioning authority, or atypical social preferences. The primary care provider can provide information and anticipatory guidance to help with these challenges.
Important aspects of anticipatory guidance for parents and siblings of gifted children include [10,11,20]:
•	Provision of information about identification practices, educational, and programming options (see "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Identification' and 'Types of intervention' above)
•	Demystification of giftedness
•	Assurance that most gifted children have good psychosocial adjustment (See "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Emotional characteristics'.)
•	Guidance about how to manage the differences imposed by giftedness
•	Asynchronous development
•	Internal drive (eg, wanting to spend excessive time on areas of interest); the parents can set time limits to help the child balance the area of interest with other important aspects of childhood (eg, having friends and having fun)
•	Perfectionism and its attendant frustration (encourage them to help the child set realistic goals, focus on the process rather than the outcome, and to value the lessons learned from their mistakes) [6,40]
•	Atypical social preferences (eg, older children, adults); contact with other gifted children of the same age is a major benefit of special programs for gifted children (see 'Social and emotional development' above)
•	More frequent questioning of authority; when the parent’s authority is questioned, s/he can respond with something like: “I have to do my job. My job is to make sure that you perform well in all areas of life, not just those that you prefer.”  
•	Letting them know that it is normal to feel inadequate or ill-equipped to raise a gifted child; there is no single best way to raise a gifted child as long as the parents set clear and high expectations and are invested and responsive (eg, respect the child’s questions, provide interesting experiences, etc) [6,41]
•	Helping them avoid resentment of the gifted child by his or her nongifted siblings (by encouraging them to consider each of their children unique, with individual strengths and weaknesses rather than gifted/not gifted and encouraging them to spend designated special time with each child)
•	Helping them to understand that, despite their differences, gifted children should be expected to participate in family and community life, to respect household rules, to participate in tasks, chores, etc. This is true no matter how much time is dedicated to talent development or how sophisticated the child is at arguing that they need not comply with ordinary rules of conduct
Assessing program quality — The following questions can help parents assess the child’s current programming, and help decide if evaluation and specialized or gifted programming is needed:
•	Does the child enjoy school?
•	Is the child learning new information, or simply repeating topics already mastered?
•	Are academic strengths as well as weaknesses noticed in the student?
•	Does the teacher know the child, and does the teacher know what the child can really do?
•	Is the school able to be flexible in matching educational programs to the child’s interests and needs?
•	Does the school offer educational acceleration, enrichment, or ability grouping?
Monitoring for vulnerabilities — Although gifted children generally have good emotional adjustment, they have particular areas of emotional vulnerability. It is important for the primary care provider to monitor for these problems and make referrals to mental health providers as necessary.
These vulnerabilities include [6,7,40]:
•	Sensitivity, emotional intensity, loneliness and social isolation (particularly for those with intelligence quotient >160) (see "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Social characteristics')
•	Maladaptive perfectionism, which may lead to anxiety, or depression (see "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Emotional characteristics')
•	Asynchronous development in social, emotional, and intellectual domains (see "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Developmental characteristics')
•	Maladaptive behaviors and academic failure if not sufficiently challenged and supported (see 'Overview' above)
Additional information about balancing psychosocial health with giftedness is available in reference [42].
Advocacy — The primary care provider may be able to provide information or resources about programs to help the gifted student explore his or her interests in greater depth and to interact with peers who have similar interests and abilities. (See 'Resources' below.)
Practitioners who are familiar with local school districts and programs may be able to help parents negotiate with school personnel to determine the optimum interventions for their child [7,10].
OUTCOME — Longitudinal studies of children identified as intellectually advanced in elementary school indicate that, as a group, they continue to achieve at relatively high levels of competence [7]. However, there is individual variation. Opportunities for education and mentoring, socioeconomic conditions, individual social skills and motivation, and participation in talent development programs may affect long-term outcomes [21,43,44]. In observational studies, higher achievement appears to be associated with high and clear parental expectations and a flexible but firm parenting style [6,41].
Most gifted children do well as adults. However, they do not necessarily make major contributions to their particular domain [44]. Above the level of 120, intelligence quotient appears not to predict adult eminence [45].
Gifted students can and do drop out of school. The number of gifted students who drop out is unclear because of the limited number of quality studies and the varying definitions of giftedness [46]. However, gifted students may be over-represented among high school dropouts. In one study of gifted high school drop-outs, the reasons for dropping out varied, but not liking school was a major factor [47].
The long-term course of nonschool-house talents (eg, music, chess, athletics) is variable. It depends upon the social value placed upon the talent, opportunities for expert instruction, and the child’s dedication [7].
RESOURCES — Resources for clinicians and families are provided in the Table (table 2).
SUMMARY
•	Gifted individuals have exceptional abilities in a particular domain or domains (eg, mathematics, music, athletics). The United States Department of Education definition for giftedness (table 1) is the most widely accepted by researchers and practitioners in the field of giftedness. (See "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Introduction' and "The gifted child: Characteristics and identification", section on 'Terminology'.)
•	The development of giftedness is a long-term endeavor, fostered by early identification, supportive and encouraging parents, and teachers and mentors who place high expectations on the student. Gifted students need to be challenged to maintain interest and high achievement. Those who are not sufficiently challenged may develop maladaptive behaviors, mental health conditions (eg, depression), and/or academic failure. Lack of challenge can inhibit the development of self-confidence and lead to poor study habits. (See 'Overview' above.)
